# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages that Data Scientists use.
# - List commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists.
# - Comment on Data Science tools.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Java
# 5. Julia
# 6. Scala

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. TensorFlow
# 2. NumPy
# 3. SciPy
# 4. Pandas
# 5. Matplotlib
# 6. Keras
# 7. SciKit-Learn
# 8. PyTorch
# 9. Scrapy

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 
# 1. 3+5=8
# 2. 4*3=12
# 3. 14/2=7
# 4. 5-5=0

# In[1]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

(3*4)+5


# In[2]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

days = 0
hours = 0
mins = 0

time = 200
#days = time / 1440
leftover_minutes = time % 1440
hours = leftover_minutes / 60
#mins = time - (days*1440) - (hours*60)
print(str(days) + " days, " + str(hours) + " hours, " + str(mins) +  " mins. ")
